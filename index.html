        They eat at the campus cafeteria at least 3-4 times a day, and don’t want to opt for food
        from outside due to a variety of reasons which range from the mess food being convenient &
        accessible to the fact that they have already paid for it and don’t want to spend extra for
        food outside to not having cooking facilities set up in their apartments.

          Protein requirements are being met sufficiently for non-vegetarians on days that chicken
          is served. Chicken is only served on Wednesdays at Lunch. For vegetarians and for all
          other days, dal curry, buttermilk, eggs may be consumed to meet protein requirements.

          Contrary to complains about the lack of items containing fiber, there are enough items to
          suffice the daily fiber requirements.

        <li class="mb-5">
          A single boiled egg constitutes 55% of the daily cholesterol requirement.
